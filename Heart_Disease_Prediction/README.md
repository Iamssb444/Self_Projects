# Heart Disease Prediction
The potential Heart Diseases in people are forecasted using Machine learning algorithms K Neighbor Classifier and  Decision Tree Classifier.
# Imported several libraries for the project:

Numpy: To work with arrays

Pandas: To work with csv files and dataframes

matplotlib: To create charts using pyplot, define parameters using rcParams and color them with cm.rainbow

warnings: To ignore all warnings which might be showing up in the notebook due to past/future depreciation of a feature

train_test_split: To split the dataset into training and testing data

StandardScaler: To scale all the features, so that the Machine Learning model better adapts to the dataset

Steps:

# Import Dataset
-Imported CSV file

# Understanding the Data
-Different plots gives idea about the data

# Data Processing
-Converted categorial columns into 0 and 1.

# Machine Learning
-Used 2 algorithms:
  -K neighbors Classifier
  -Decision Tree classifier.
